# Animating Chart Example

### Build Commands

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# build
npm run build
```

And open `index.html` in your browser.

### Requirements

The goal is to develop software for showing simple charts based on input data we provide. You can use either JavaScript, Android Java or iOS Swift. 

Note: you may not use specialized charting libraries. All the code you submit must be written by you from scratch.

The criteria weâ€™ll be using to define the winner are speed, efficiency and the size of the app.
